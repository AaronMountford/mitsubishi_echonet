# mitsubishi_echonet
A library for interfacing with Mitsubishi HVAC with the Echonet lite protoocl over WiFi adaptors such as the MAC-568IF-E
It is specifically designed for use with Home Assistant, and its functionality is limited to HVAC systems, 
but it could be potentally extended for other Echonet applications and become a more general purpose library.

Similar implementations seem to be Node JS middleware running on Docker containers to interface into the MQTT API
however this is designed to be used as an old school library, no middleware, Node JS or Docker needed!


It is designed to work with Python 3.7 out of the box as that was the environment I was working on.

Comments and suggestions are welcome!
