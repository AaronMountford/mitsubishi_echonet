NOTE: For Home Assistant users there is now a dedicated repo for the related Home Assistant 'Mitsubishi' custom component that makes use of this Python library:
(https://github.com/scottyphillips/mitsubishi_hass)

The custom component examples in the /bin directory will be removed from this
repo at a later release and this repo will focus solely on the Python library.

'example.py' in the /bin directory gives you an idea how to drive the
HVAC directly from Python using this library.
